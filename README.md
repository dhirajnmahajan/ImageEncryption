# ImageEncryption

A  Image Encryption project in Java.

####Here I have made the Image Encryption Project to encrypt and decrypt the image.It is created in VS Code IDE and compiled with the javac compiler.


####In this program I used the concept like Applet and XOR Operation . On the basis of Applet I created the openImage button and various predefined funtions to select image. 

####Encryption :- is the process of converting information or data into a secrete code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.

####Decryption:- means the conversion of encrypted data into its original form is nothing but Decryption. 


##Image Encryption:

__For encryption, we will convert the image into a byte array and after converting it we will apply XOR operation on each value of the byte array and after performing XOR operation on each and every value of byte array will be changed.

__After performing the operation now we will write new data in Image due to which we are unable to open the Encrypted Image.

## FAQ

#### How to Encrypt the image ?

1. First of all, enter any digits and press the 'openImage' button for selection of image.

2. After selecting the image, that image will be encrypt automatically and 'Done' message will be prompted after few seconds.

(Note: Rembered that digits which you entered for encryption in input box. )

#### How to Decrypt the image ?


Encryption Key act as "Password" to Decrypt the same Image,otherwise it will corrupt the Image.

(So entered those digits, which you entered during the encryption.)

## Lessons Learned

At the time of making this project I learn more about XOR Operation. How to used the XOR Operaion in real-world project or software.
